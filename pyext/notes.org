It would be good to consider Jit compilers for speed during design
** JAX
   - Auto diff native python and NumPy functions
   - Diff through loops, branches, recursions, and closures
   - reverse-mode differentiation, backprop via grad
   - uses the XLA compiler (Accelerated Linear Algebra)
*** Functions
**** grad
**** jit
**** vmap
**** pmap

** Numba
   - Uses the LLVM compiler
   - Open source from Anaconda
